### this section is also known as "some things about me":
- i love my Moondrop Aria 2s and i will go out of my way to get someone to get into IEMs whenever audio is mentioned
- i use [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
- i am an avid lurker and occasional poster on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn)
- turning a feature off and breaking something is worth it for the satisfaction of having it off as long as it mostly still works
